      <span>W</span>ords aren't enough to express my gratitude to you, my love. They say happiness has 9 letters, but mine has only four‚ù§Ô∏è. You brought light into my world at a time it was dark. You gave it color and life the moment you walked in.
      To think that you'd be the person who lit my spark again ‚Äî you reignited the fire that was once dimmed off. A stranger became familiar, and now you're an irreplaceable part of my life. Such a blessing does not go unnoticed, mami‚ù§Ô∏è.

      <span>O</span>ur first meetup on 6th October marked the genesis of this amazing life that we share. It was love at first sight when I finally laid my eyes on you. 
      Your lethal face card, your sweet smile, and your eyes that spoke volumes‚Äîhow they glittered gracefully under the afternoon rays. I got lost in them. Taking it all in took my breath away. ‚ù§Ô∏è
      It was one hell of a view. A view that I told myself I'd love to see for the rest of my life.‚ù§Ô∏è

    <p>
      <span>I</span> fell in love with your beauty, but I fell deeper for the other things about you as the days went by. I love your smile and vow to do everything in my power to keep it on your face forever. I love your energetic yappingüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äîhow you can talk for hours without rest, how your face lights up when you talk about things you love.
      I love how your eyes glitter with joy and excitement, filling my heart with warmth. ‚ù§Ô∏è I love your kindness and how you care about me every day. I love your way of thinking, how you approach certain topics. It is so attractive and one can only admire your logical way of doing things.‚ù§Ô∏è

      <span>A</span>nd yet, there's so much more to love about you. We are still learning about one another. We come from different upbringings, grew up in different environments, and have different pasts, all of which have shaped us.
